Fastag Fraud Detection Model
AIM:
The aim of a Fastag fraud detection model using machine learning (ML) is to identify and prevent fraudulent activities related to the use of Fastags.and adapt to new patterns of fraudulent behavior, enhancing the accuracy of fraud detection over time.
Objective of Model 
Early Detection of Fraud: ML models can analyze transaction patterns and identify anomalies or suspicious activities that may indicate fraudulent behavior. Early detection allows for timely intervention and prevention of potential financial losses.
Reducing False Negatives: It's crucial to minimize false negatives to avoid inconveniencing legitimate users. ML models can be fine-tuned to distinguish between normal and potentially fraudulent transactions, reducing the chances of incorrectly flagging genuine activities as fraudulent.
Improving Accuracy: ML algorithms can continuously learn and adapt to new patterns of fraudulent behavior, enhancing the accuracy of fraud detection over time. Regular updates and retraining of the model help it stay effective against evolving fraud techniques.
Conclusion: The final take away form this project is the working of different machine learning models on a dataset and understanding their parameters. Creating this notebook helped me to learn a lot about the parameters of the models, how to tune them and how they affect the model performance.

The final conclusion on the fastag fraud detection dataset is that SVM is working exceptionally well with accuracy of 98 on the data taken as compared to other models.we have focus on Recall i.e to reduce false negatives,overall in all ML modules Recall value is high.
